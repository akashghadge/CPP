/*
In a stock market, there is a product with its infinite stocks. The stock prices are given for N days, where arr[i] denotes the price of the stock on the ith day. There is a rule that a customer can buy at most i stock on the ith day. If the customer has an amount of k amount of money initially, find out the maximum number of stocks a customer can buy. 

For example, for 3 days the price of a stock is given as 7, 10, 4. You can buy 1 stock worth 7 rs on day 1, 2 stocks worth 10 rs each on day 2 and 3 stock worth 4 rs each on day 3.

Examples: 



Input : price[] = { 10, 7, 19 }, 
              k = 45.
Output : 4
A customer purchases 1 stock on day 1, 
2 stocks on day 2 and 1 stock on day 3 for 
10, 7 * 2 = 14 and 19 respectively. Hence, 
total amount is 10 + 14 + 19 = 43 and number 
of stocks purchased is 4.

Input  : price[] = { 7, 10, 4 }, 
               k = 100.
Output : 6
