/*
Shibam is asked to organise a Tug of War competition for which he has to create two groups of people.
There are N people who are participating in the game who are numbered from 1 to N. The i-th person has a strength of i units. Shibam has to divide the people into two groups A and B such that the absolute value of the difference of total strength of the two groups is as low as possible.
The total strength of a group is the sum of the strengths of each person in that group.
Help Shibam find the minimum absolute difference.
Input
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each test case contains an integer N, the number of people participating.
Output
For each test case print an integer,the minimum value of the absolute difference.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^9
Example
Input:
1
3
Output:
0

Explanation

Group A will contain persons 1 and 2. Group B will containg person 3. So ans = |(1+2)-(3)| = 0.
