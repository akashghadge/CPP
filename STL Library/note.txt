here vectors are basically resizable arrays and list are same as linked list
accesing element for vectors are quite easy and list needs to traverse all elements

deleteding and inserting at middle and other than middle in list perform in some fixed time and faster and opposite in vector cause it is array

size of list is larger and vector is lower
